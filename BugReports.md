All Other Issues

If you have a support contract, please follow the appropriate escalation
path as outlined in your contract.

Other users may report runtime issues to the [discusslist](http://lists.omniti.com/mailman/listinfo/omnios-discuss) or submit
a pull request on [Github](https://github.com/omniosorg/omnios-build/issues)
for build issues.

Since OmniOS is based on illumos, the majority of the software delivered
with the system is part of the [illumos source tree](http://src.illumos.org/source/). If you are experiencing problems
with the kernel or software not [added by OmniOS](https://github.com/omniti-labs/omnios-build/tree/r151006/build),
the wider illumos community may be able to help as well. Please help by
[reporting your issue](http://wiki.illumos.org/display/illumos/How+To+Report+Problems)
so that the whole community may benefit.
